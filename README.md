# Simple-Cafe-Data-Insights
Welcome to Simple Cafe Data Insights, a beginner-friendly data analysis project based on a fictional cafe's order history.
This project explores how a small cafe gain meaningful business insights using **Excel**, **Python (Pandas & Matplotlib)**, and **data visualisation techniques**.

"Simple Cafe Data Insighst" is a data analysis project simulating operations of a newly opened cafe named 'My Bae'. The goal is to uncover actionalbe insights using Excel and Python for better business decisions. The data used is randomly generated but modeled to reflect realistic cafe operations including sales patterns, product demand, and customer behaviour.

For more accuracy, the sample data assumes the cafe operates daily from 6:00 AM to 3:30 PM, and all timestamps are generated within this range. 

# Project Goals
- Understand customer purchasing behaviour.
- Analyse categorised revenue trends.
- Identify best-selling menu.
- Visualise time-based sales trends.

# Tools used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Sample data creation, Pivot tables, charts, formula-based analysis.
- **Python**: Pandas, visualisation with Matplotlib.

## Sample Visualisations
| Daily Sales | Revenue by Category |

## Key Insights
* Daily Sales Trends
    - Tuesday had the lowest toatal sales, with #136.
    - Saturday ($497.5) and Sunday ($522.5) recorded the highest sales during the week.
    - This pattern indicates that weekends are the most profitable days for this cafe.
* Revenue by Category (Excel-based)
    - Coffee generated the highest revenue of $1,238.5
    - Desserts followed with $575
    - Tea had the lowest revenue: $382.5
* Python-based Analysis
    - Although slight differences exist bue to the use of RANDBETWEEN() Formula generation in Excel, both analyses confirm the same trend:
  Coffee is the best selling category, tea is the least performing category.
    - Similarly, weekend sales are consistently higher, with Tuesday remaining the lowest day.
      
## Business Recommendations based on Analysis
Based on the insights from the dataset, here are four key strategies to improve the cafe's performance and revenue:

* Tuesday Moring Set Promotion
   - By offering a Coffee (only limited coffee menu) + Scone at a discounted price during morning hours, attract students and workers to increase sales on the lowest-performing day of the week.
   - Review total sales for the next three months to determine whether the business should keep this promotion or develop other strategies.
* Best & Worst Sellers Review
   - Analyse the Top 3 best-selling menu items and identify the least popular items. Improve or remove underperforming products to optimise the menu and reduce waste.
* Customer Feedback & Menu Development
   - Collect regular customer feedback and use data insights to develop new menu items that align with customer preferences and seasonal trends.
* Launch a Loyalty Programme
   - Introduce a simple stamp-based loyalty programme to boost repeat visits and strengthen customer engagement.
